## Muuuuu (working title)
_a soulseek-inspired p2p music sharing web app_

### Why?
Simply because WebRTC and Soulseek are cool, I wanted to learn
ClojureScript and I had some time off because of some profitable
bitcoin fluctuations. It's purely a demo app of what is possible
 with html5 features and ClojureScript with the excellent Om 
library. I have no means turning it into a business.

### Feedback please
This is my first Clojure(script) app. Any feedback from tricks to
architectural tips are more than welcome! Pull requests, email, twitter
 whatsoever!:)

### Current status
Finishing UI events, next up WebRTC

### Run

```make run```

### Compile css
Sorry, this requires node and stylus to be installed. Would love to have
a Clojure alternative.

```make build css```
